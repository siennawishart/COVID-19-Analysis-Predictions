# COVID-19-Analysis-Predictions
The goals of this project are to use data analysis and modelling to:
- Observe the current state of COVID-19 in Canada
- Compare differences amongst provinces, with a focus on Quebec and BC
- Compare Canada's status with other countries
- Predict world-wide COVID-19 numbers over 7 days.

Features created:
- The number of deaths per case and the number of tests per population were compared to determine if the number of reported cases are accurate or if instead more testing needs to be done in the region.
- The number of cases per test provides an idea of what percentage of a population has COVID-19, while taking into account the limitations in testing.
- Severity (sum of ICU cases, hospitalizations, number of deaths) provides unbiased trends into the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in a region.
- The number of ICU cases per death also provides unbiased trends that show when a region's cases have steadied.
- The number of cases per test can show the effects of a region's testing when looked at in conjunction with the number of tests per population.

Quebec, the Canadian province hit hardest by COVID-19, should have followed British Columbia's COVID-19 testing and control strategies from the beginning, including province-wide communication within the healthcare industry, lots of testing early on, restricting long term care workers to one long term care facility, and recommending against non-essential travel early on.

The shape of Canada's infection curves are similar to countries with major outbreaks. As such, Canada should take note of other countries' plans for reopening and their results when devising a plan for reopening and containment of the outbreak. Based on time series analysis predictions, global cases, deaths, and recoveries will continue to rise exponentially over the next 7 days after May 4th, 2020.
